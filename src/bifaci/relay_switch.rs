//! RelaySwitch — Cap-aware routing multiplexer for multiple RelayMasters
//!
//! The RelaySwitch sits above multiple RelayMasters and provides deterministic
//! request routing based on cap URN matching. It plays the same role for RelayMasters
//! that CartridgeHost plays for cartridges.
//!
//! ## Architecture

//! ## Routing Rules
//!
//! **Engine → Cartridge**:
//! - REQ: route by cap URN using `is_dispatchable` + closest-specificity matching
//! - Continuation frames: route by req_id
//!
//! **Cartridge → Cartridge** (peer invocations):
//! - REQ from master: route to destination master (may be same or different)
//! - Mark in peer_requests set (special cleanup semantics)
//! - Response frames: route back to source master
//!
//! **Cleanup**:
//! - Engine-initiated: cartridge's END → cleanup immediately
//! - Peer-initiated: engine's response END → cleanup (wait for final response)
//!
//! ## Concurrency Model
//!
//! RelaySwitch uses interior mutability to allow concurrent DAG executions:
//! - All methods take `&self` (not `&mut self`)
//! - xid_counter: AtomicU64
//! - Routing maps: RwLock<HashMap<...>>
//! - Per-master socket writers: Mutex<FrameWriter<...>>
//! - Each execute_fanin spawns its own pump that cooperatively routes frames
