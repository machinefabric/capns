//! Adapter types for file type detection

//! This module defines the result types used by the adapter system and the
//! `CartridgeAdapterInvoker` trait for invoking cartridge content-inspection
//! adapters over the Bifaci protocol.

/// read at most this many bytes so cartridge handlers and the
/// engine's pattern validators see exactly the same prefix.

/// JSON top-level structures, and the first few pages of text in any
/// realistic file format, while keeping per-file analysis bounded so
/// dropping a folder of large media doesn't push hundreds of MB
