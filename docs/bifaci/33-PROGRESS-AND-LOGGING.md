# Progress and Logging

How plugins emit progress updates and log messages, and how these flow through the execution chain.

## LOG Frames

LOG frames are how plugins communicate status to the engine and UI during request handling. They are non-terminal — a handler can emit LOG frames at any point between the first STREAM_START and the final END. LOG frames travel alongside data frames on the same request channel and interleave freely with CHUNK frames.

Each LOG frame carries metadata in key 5 (meta map): a `level` string and a `message` string. Progress frames add a `progress` float.

LOG frames do not affect the data stream. They are informational — the engine can consume them, forward them, or ignore them without impacting correctness.

Source: `capdag/src/bifaci/frame.rs` (`Frame::log`, `Frame::progress`).

### Log Levels

Standard levels:

| Level | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `"info"` | Informational messages. |
| `"warn"` | Warnings that do not stop execution. |
| `"error"` | Error messages. Non-terminal — the request continues. For terminal errors, send an ERR frame instead. |
| `"progress"` | Progress update. Includes a float value (0.0–1.0) in `meta["progress"]`. |
| `"status"` | Status messages. Used for things like download file names. |

Custom levels are allowed. The engine passes them through without interpretation.

## Progress Frames

Progress frames are LOG frames with `level = "progress"` and an additional `progress` float (0.0–1.0) in the meta map. The engine uses this value to update task progress in the database and UI.

```rust
// Constructing a progress frame
Frame::progress(request_id, 0.5, "Processing page 3 of 6");
// Produces meta: {"level": "progress", "message": "Processing page 3 of 6", "progress": 0.5}
```

The `log_progress()` method on `Frame` returns `Some(f32)` only when the level is `"progress"`. A LOG frame with a different level and a progress field in meta returns `None` — the level check is strict.

Progress values do not ratchet. A handler can emit 0.8 followed by 0.3. There is no monotonicity enforcement in the protocol or the database. This is intentional — some operations genuinely revisit earlier states (e.g., multi-pass encoding).

Source: `frame.rs` (`Frame::progress`, `log_progress`).

### Emitting Progress

From a handler, use the `OutputStream` methods:

```rust
// Progress update with value and message
req.output().progress(0.5, "Halfway through inference");

// Log message with custom level
req.output().log("info", "Found 12 images in document");
```

Both methods construct a LOG frame with the correct request_id and routing_id and send it through the output channel. They do not block.

Source: `capdag/src/bifaci/plugin_runtime.rs` (`OutputStream::progress`, `OutputStream::log`).

### Handler Progress Conventions

ML cartridges follow a standard progress layout:

| Range | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| [0.00, 0.25] | Model download (peer call to modelcartridge). Progress from the peer is mapped to this range. |
| 0.25 | Loading model into memory (blocking FFI, keepalive emits here). |
| 0.35 | Model loaded, starting inference. |
| [0.35, 0.95] | Inference progress (per-token for text generation, per-step for image processing). |
| 0.95 | Complete. |

These are conventions, not protocol requirements. Content cartridges (PDF, text) use simpler layouts since their operations are faster.

## Keepalive Frames

Keepalive frames solve a specific problem: blocking FFI calls (model loads) can starve the frame writer, causing the engine to think the plugin is dead.

### The Problem

The plugin's frame writer task runs on a tokio worker thread. It drains the output channel and writes frames to stdout. When a handler calls a blocking FFI function (e.g., `llama_model_load()` which can take minutes for large models), the call runs on the same tokio worker thread pool.

If all tokio workers are occupied by blocking calls, the writer task cannot run. Frames queued in the output channel sit there — even frames emitted before the blocking call started. The engine sees no frames arriving on stdout and, after 120 seconds of silence, triggers its activity timeout and kills the task.

The sequence:

```
Handler emits progress(0.25, "Loading model...")   → queued in channel
Handler calls llama_model_load()                    → blocks tokio worker
Writer task needs a tokio worker to drain channel   → none available
30s pass... 60s... 90s... 120s                      → engine timeout
```

### run_with_keepalive (Rust)

`OutputStream::run_with_keepalive()` fixes this by running the blocking work on a separate thread pool:

```rust
pub async fn run_with_keepalive<T: Send + 'static>(
    &self,
    progress: f32,
    message: &str,
    f: impl FnOnce() -> T + Send + 'static,
) -> T
```

What it does:

1. **Spawns the closure on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`** — a dedicated thread pool for blocking work, separate from the tokio async workers. The closure runs without blocking any tokio worker.
2. **Runs a keepalive loop** using `tokio::select!` with a `tokio::time::interval(30s)`. Every 30 seconds, it emits a progress frame with the given value and message.
3. **Returns the closure's result** when `spawn_blocking` completes. The keepalive loop stops.

Because `spawn_blocking` frees the tokio workers, the writer task can run and flush keepalive frames to stdout. The engine sees frames every 30 seconds and resets its 120-second timeout.

```rust
// Usage in a handler
let model = req.output().run_with_keepalive(
    0.25,
    "Loading model...",
    move || LlamaModel::load_from_file(&model_path, &params),
).await;
```

Source: `plugin_runtime.rs` (`run_with_keepalive`, line 613).

### runWithKeepalive (Swift)

The Swift equivalent in `capdag-objc/Sources/Bifaci/PluginRuntime.swift` uses structured concurrency:

1. Spawns a background `Task` that emits progress frames every 30 seconds.
2. Awaits the async operation.
3. Cancels the keepalive `Task` when the operation completes.

The mechanism differs (Swift uses `Task` cancellation instead of `tokio::select!`) but the effect is identical: keepalive frames flow to the engine while blocking work runs.

## ProgressSender

`ProgressSender` is a detachable handle for emitting progress and log frames from inside a `spawn_blocking` closure. It is `Clone + Send + Sync + 'static`, so it can cross thread boundaries freely.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ProgressSender {
    sender: Arc<dyn FrameSender>,
    request_id: MessageId,
    routing_id: Option<MessageId>,
}

impl ProgressSender {
    pub fn progress(&self, progress: f32, message: &str);
    pub fn log(&self, level: &str, message: &str);
}
```

Create one via `output.progress_sender()`:

```rust
let ps = req.output().progress_sender();
let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
    // Runs on blocking thread pool
    ps.progress(0.4, "Processing token 50 of 200");
    do_inference(&model, &input, |token_idx, total| {
        ps.progress(0.35 + 0.6 * (token_idx as f32 / total as f32), "Generating...");
    })
}).await.unwrap();
```

The key difference from `run_with_keepalive`: `ProgressSender` gives the closure control over when and what progress to emit, rather than emitting a fixed keepalive value at a fixed interval. Use `run_with_keepalive` for simple blocking calls (model loads). Use `ProgressSender` when the blocking work itself can report granular progress (per-token inference, multi-file processing).

The vision pipeline in ggufcartridge uses `ProgressSender` because `VisionEngine<'a>` borrows from the model and cannot be returned from `spawn_blocking` — the entire pipeline (load + inference) must run in a single blocking closure, and per-token progress needs to be emitted from inside it.

Source: `plugin_runtime.rs` (`ProgressSender`, line 357; `progress_sender`, line 591).

## Activity Timeout

The engine enforces an activity timeout of 120 seconds (`DEFAULT_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_SECS` in `capdag/src/orchestrator/executor.rs`). Any frame on the response channel — including LOG, progress, and heartbeat responses — resets the timer. If no frames arrive for 120 seconds, the engine terminates the task with `ExecutionError::ActivityTimeout`.

The 30-second keepalive interval provides a 4x safety margin: even if one keepalive frame is delayed, the next one arrives well before the timeout.

Individual caps can override the default timeout via the `activity_timeout` field in their definition. This is used for caps that are known to have long silent periods that cannot be interrupted with keepalive frames.

## Progress Mapping Through the Execution Chain

Progress values pass through several layers between the plugin and the UI:

```
Plugin handler ──► OutputStream.progress(0.5, "...")
                        │
                        ▼
                   LOG frame on stdout
                        │
                        ▼
              PluginHostRuntime (pass-through)
                        │
                        ▼
              RelaySlave → RelayMaster (pass-through)
                        │
                        ▼
              execute_fanin → CapProgressFn callback
                        │
                        ▼
              cap_interpreter → maps to step's range in task
                        │
                        ▼
              SQLite database → UI
```

1. **Plugin handler**: Emits raw progress in [0.0, 1.0].
2. **Peer call forwarding**: If the handler is forwarding peer progress, it maps the peer's [0.0, 1.0] to a sub-range (e.g., [0.0, 0.25]) using `map_progress(value, base, weight)`.
3. **execute_fanin**: The orchestrator's execution loop reads LOG frames from the response channel and calls the `CapProgressFn` callback with the plugin's progress value.
4. **cap_interpreter**: Maps the cap's [0.0, 1.0] progress to the step's allocated range within the overall task progress.
5. **Database**: The mapped value is written to SQLite. The UI reads it.

See [42-PROGRESS-MAPPING.md](42-PROGRESS-MAPPING.md) for how `ProgressMapper` deterministically subdivides progress ranges across steps.

## Logging Restrictions

Plugins do not have a tracing subscriber. The following do not work inside plugin processes:

- **`tracing::info!()`, `tracing::debug!()`, etc.**: No subscriber is installed. Messages are silently dropped.
- **`eprintln!()`, `fputs(stderr)`**: In a GUI app sandbox, stderr goes to `/dev/null`. On macOS, `write()` to a dead stderr can block forever — this was the root cause of the `clip_log_callback_default` deadlock in ggufcartridge, where the CLIP model loader's log callback called `fputs(text, stderr)` and blocked indefinitely.

The only way to emit observable output from a plugin is through LOG frames via `output.log()` and `output.progress()`. These send frames through the stdout channel, which the host receives and processes.

For FFI libraries that have their own log callbacks (llama.cpp, CLIP/MTMD), the callback must be redirected to a no-op function. `LlamaBackend::void_logs()` suppresses llama logs; `mtmd_log_set()` suppresses CLIP/MTMD logs. Both must be called before loading models.
