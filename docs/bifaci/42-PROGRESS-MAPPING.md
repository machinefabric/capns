# Progress Mapping

How progress values are deterministically subdivided and mapped through nested execution layers.

## map_progress

The core mapping function translates a child's [0.0, 1.0] progress range into a parent's sub-range:

```rust
pub fn map_progress(child_progress: f32, base: f32, weight: f32) -> f32 {
    base + child_progress.clamp(0.0, 1.0) * weight
}
```

A child reporting 0.5 within a range `[base=0.25, weight=0.5]` maps to `0.25 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.50`.

This single function is used everywhere progress is subdivided: DAG execution, ForEach plans, peer call delegation, and UI progress reporting. There are no alternative formulas — consistency across all layers depends on this one computation.

## DAG-Level Subdivision

The executor pre-computes progress boundaries for each edge group before execution:

```
boundaries[i] = i as f32 / n_groups as f32
```

Group `i` gets the range `[boundaries[i], boundaries[i+1])`. For a DAG with 4 groups:

| Group | Base | Weight | Range |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 0 | 0.00 | 0.25 | [0.00, 0.25) |
| 1 | 0.25 | 0.25 | [0.25, 0.50) |
| 2 | 0.50 | 0.25 | [0.50, 0.75) |
| 3 | 0.75 | 0.25 | [0.75, 1.00] |

Computing boundaries with a single division (rather than accumulated additions) avoids floating-point rounding errors that would cause progress to drift or exceed 1.0.

## ProgressMapper

`ProgressMapper` wraps a `CapProgressFn` callback with a range subdivision:

```rust
pub struct ProgressMapper {
    base: f32,
    weight: f32,
    parent: CapProgressFn,
}
```

**`report(child_progress, cap_urn, msg)`** — Maps the child value into the parent range and calls the parent callback:

```rust
pub fn report(&self, child_progress: f32, cap_urn: &str, msg: &str) {
    let overall = map_progress(child_progress, self.base, self.weight);
    (self.parent)(overall, cap_urn, msg);
}
```

**`sub_mapper(sub_base, sub_weight)`** — Creates a nested `ProgressMapper` for further subdivision. The sub-mapper's effective range is the intersection of the parent's range and the sub-range. This is how multi-level nesting works: each level narrows the range further.

**`as_cap_progress_fn()`** — Converts the mapper into an `Arc<dyn Fn(f32, &str, &str) + Send + Sync>` for passing to APIs that expect a `CapProgressFn`.

Source: `types.rs` (`ProgressMapper`, line 73).

## Nested Mapping Example

A concrete example showing how a progress value flows through three layers:

**Setup**: A DAG with 2 groups. An ML cartridge in group 0 downloads a model via peer call, then runs inference.

**Layer 1 — DAG execution**: Group 0 gets range [0.0, 0.5].

**Layer 2 — Handler peer call**: The handler reserves [0.0, 0.25] of its own range for the download peer call, and [0.25, 1.0] for inference.

**Layer 3 — modelcartridge download**: Reports progress as files complete.

The value flows:

```
modelcartridge reports: progress(0.6, "Downloading file 3 of 5")
    │
    │  Handler's peer call mapping: map_progress(0.6, 0.0, 0.25) = 0.15
    │
    ▼
Handler forwards to CapProgressFn: progress(0.15, "cap:...", "Downloading file 3 of 5")
    │
    │  DAG group 0 mapping: map_progress(0.15, 0.0, 0.5) = 0.075
    │
    ▼
cap_interpreter maps to task step range: progress(0.075, ...)
    │
    ▼
SQLite: UPDATE task SET progress = 0.075
```

The same chain when inference is at 50%:

```
Handler reports: progress(0.5, "Generating token 50 of 100")
    │
    │  Handler's own range: map_progress(0.5, 0.25, 0.75) = 0.625
    │
    ▼
CapProgressFn: progress(0.625, "cap:...", "Generating token 50 of 100")
    │
    │  DAG group 0: map_progress(0.625, 0.0, 0.5) = 0.3125
    │
    ▼
SQLite: progress = 0.3125
```

## Progress Ratchet

There is no progress ratchet in the database. `update_progress_impl` does a plain SQL UPDATE — progress values can go backwards. A handler can emit 0.8 followed by 0.3 and both values are written as-is.

This is intentional. A ratchet (where progress can only increase) would hide bugs where progress is emitted out of order. It would also interfere with operations that genuinely revisit earlier states, such as multi-pass encoding or retry loops.

## Properties

The mapping scheme guarantees:

- **Monotonicity within a layer**: If child values increase monotonically, mapped values increase monotonically within that group's range. (Monotonicity across groups is guaranteed by sequential execution.)
- **Bounded**: Mapped values stay within `[base, base + weight]` because `clamp(0.0, 1.0)` limits the child's contribution.
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce the same output — no random or time-dependent components.
- **Non-negative**: All mapped values are ≥ 0 (assuming non-negative base and weight).
- **Composable**: Nested `ProgressMapper` instances compose correctly — the effective range narrows multiplicatively at each level.
